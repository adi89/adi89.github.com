            <h3> My Story </h3>
              <p>
                Having studied at Rutgers University, I graduated with a BS in Biomedical Engineering. I have taken classes in biomedical devices, global health, and have run a gauntlet of math and science courses. Overall, the experience challenged me and gave me he ability to manifest my thought patterns in a logical and optimized form. </p>

                <p>In a short span of time, I have transitioned from a Biomedical Engineer to a aspiring web developer, gaining skills in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Postgres(SQL), HTML/CSS in the mean time. </p>
